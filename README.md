🌍 Countries Explorer – Project Description

In this project, I created a Countries Explorer web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.
The main objective of the application is to fetch country data from an external REST API and display it dynamically on a web page.

I used the REST Countries API to fetch details such as country name, capital, region, flag, and country code. The data is retrieved using the JavaScript Fetch API, and error handling is implemented to manage unsuccessful responses.

After fetching the data, I dynamically generated Bootstrap cards to display each country’s information in a responsive grid layout. This ensures the application works well across different screen sizes.

I also implemented a real-time search feature that allows users to filter countries by name, country code, continent (region), or capital. The search functionality works instantly using JavaScript array filtering without reloading the page.

Additionally, I customized the UI by applying a custom theme color to improve the visual appearance while maintaining readability and consistency.

Overall, this project demonstrates my understanding of API integration, DOM manipulation, responsive design, and client-side data filtering.
